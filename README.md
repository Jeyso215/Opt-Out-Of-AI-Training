# Other Opt-Outs

* **OpenAI** (Includes ChaGPT and DALLÂ·E): You can opt-out of having your input and output to their services used to train by emailing your organization ID to [support@openai.com](mailto:support@openai.com). *Note: This doesn't include any data they scraped to train their model.*
* **StabilityAI**: Stable Diffusion 3 will honor opt-out requests on [haveibeentrained.com](https://haveibeentrained.com/).
* **AWS**: Instead of configuring this setting individually for each AWS account that your organization uses, you can configure an organization policy that enforces your setting choice on all accounts that are members of the organization. See [AI services opt-out policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_ai-opt-out.html)
